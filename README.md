## Write C program and compile it with GCC and RISC-V compiler and compare the outputs
  
### Task A. Writing a C program and compiling with GCC compilet

#### Step 1: open leafpad or any other text editor and write the following code

-> Command to open a file in leafpad
```ruby
  leafpad sum1ton.c &
```

-> Code:
```ruby
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
	int I, n=25, sum=0;
	for(i=0; i<=n; ++I) {
	  sum =sum + I;
	}
	
	printf(" The sum from1 to %d is &d\n" , n,sum);
	return 0;
}
```

#### Step 2: compile the code using the gcc compiler and run the executable

-> Command to compile:
```ruby
  gcc sum1ton.c 
```

-> Command to run the executable:
```ruby
  ./a.out
```

### Task B. Compiling the same program with RISC-V compiler

#### Step 1: Compailing the same C programm with RISC-V compiler ans -O1 optimization

->Command to compile:
```ruby
riscv64-unknown-elf-gcc -O1 -mabi=lp64 -march=rv64i -o sum1ton.o sum1ton.c
```
-> Command to dump the output:
```ruby
riscv64-unknown-elf-objdump -d sum1ton.o | less
```
Screenshot 4:
The number of instructions taken to execute the main block can be calculated by counting each individual instruction or subtracting the address of next block and the main block.

Observation : With the -O1 optimizer, the main block takes total 14 instructions to execute the command

#### Step 2: Compailing the same C programm with RISC-V compiler ans -Ofast optimization

->Command to compile:
```ruby
riscv64-unknown-elf-gcc -Ofast -mabi=lp64 -march=rv64i -o sum1ton.o sum1ton.c
```
-> Command to dump the output:
```ruby
riscv64-unknown-elf-objdump -d sum1ton.o | less
```
Screenshot 5:

Observation : With the -Ofast optimizer, the main block takes total 11 instructions to execute the command

## Executing and Debugging the C program with Spike Simulator

#### Step 1: Compile the C program with the RISC-V compiler with -Ofast optimizor
->Command to compile:
```ruby
riscv64-unknown-elf-gcc -Ofast -mabi=lp64 -march=rv64i -o sum1ton.o sum1ton.c
```

#### Step 2: Executing the compiled file with Spike Simulator
->Command for execution:
```ruby
spike pk sum1ton.o
```

Following is the expected output

#### Step 3: Debugging using Spike Simulator
->Command to open debugger:
```ruby
spike -d pk sumton.o 
```

We will step by step execute the instructions know what changes occur in the register values after each set of instructions run.
For that one can open the dump of the object file simultaneously.

->To run the first instruction
```ruby
until pc 0 100b0 
```

The above command will run the program till the instruction having adderess 100b0. To experiment one can take any differnt adderess and check the corrosponding reg value and observe the changes.

Screenshot of executing the above command

->To check the contents of reg
```ruby
reg 0 <reg_name>
```

For eg.
```ruby
reg 0 a0  #view contents of a0 register
reg 0 sp  #view contents of stack pointer
```

To execute next set of instructions press "enter"
